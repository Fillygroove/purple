        <p>Hello world!</p>
        <p>This is a storage website for an old collection of comics I made. I've only archived the first one out of the ones I have so far.</p>
        <p>Some of the old comics feature my deadname as opposed to my real name. I'm sharing unedited versions purely for historical reasons.</p>
        <p>I'm missing volumes 3 through volume 6, part 1. Those volumes were lost when my aunt and uncle had gotten their new car almost a full decade ago. If you have these comics it would be appreciated if you could share them!!</p>
        <p>I have the following volumes uploaded:</p>
        <a href="./volume/?v=1">Vol. 1</a>
